# TrainScheduler
## What is this?
This Web Application is a program that allows users to submit a Train, its destination, start time, and frequency or arrival, and then provides information on the given trains expected next arrival time and how long till that time. This app also incorporates firebase to allow for the submitted information to be retained amongst all users.

## How to get started
When the webpage first loads there will be a table of already existing trains, and a form below that table. To submit a new train entry, the user needs to fill out the form with information pertaining to the train that is to be tracked. Once the information is filled out and the form is submitted, the train will then be added to the table and the user will be able to keep track of the next arrival of the train.
